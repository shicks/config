# Basically, we want to make sure the device is set to the A2DP (high fidelity)
# profile, rather than the HSP/HFP (headset) profile.  See available profiles
# with
#   pactl list cards
# Sometimes apparently the A2DP profile becomes unavailable, restarting the
# bluetooth stack seems to fix this, but then we need to reconnect.
