# See: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1030678/speeding-up-the-mouse-wheel-in-ubuntu-18-04
#
# Note: we restrict to only buttons 4 and 5, we may want to do something
# special with some extra buttons eventually (e.g. Thumb1=8, Thumb2=9),
# but for now we'll keep it simple.

# The final number in the Up/Down lines is speed.  4 is a little too
# fast, so we go with 3, which is a little slower than we'd like.
# Shift is also useful for slowing it down even more.
