# Basic Instructions

These init scripts try to be forgiving of not having packages installed,
but to get the most out of them, it helps to install the following:

 *  multiple-cursors
 *  phi-search
 *  visual-regexp
 *  window-jump
 
Other packages worth installing:

 *  js2-mode
 *  typescript-mode
 *  tide

Finally, to get proper support for non-standard keybindings, it's required
to run `(sdh-xterm-mouse-mode-t)`, which can be accessed with `C-x C-m C-m`.
